# Data Analysis Using Python ðŸš€  

## Description  
This repository contains all the files and code used in the YouTube tutorial **"Master Data Analysis with Python: Cleaning, Visualizing, and Gaining Insights."** In this project, we demonstrate how to analyze data by cleaning it (removing null and duplicate values) and creating stunning visualizations to uncover meaningful insights.  

## Features  
- **Data Cleaning:** Handling missing and duplicate values.  
- **Data Visualization:** Creating graphs using libraries like Matplotlib and Seaborn.  
- **Insight Generation:** Gaining meaningful understanding of the dataset.  

## Technologies Used  
- **Python**  
- **Pandas**  
- **Matplotlib**  
- **Seaborn**  
- **Anaconda Navigator**  
- **Jupyter Notebook**  

## Getting Started  

### Prerequisites  
Make sure you have **Anaconda Navigator** installed. It provides an excellent environment for managing Python libraries and running Jupyter Notebook.  

If Anaconda is not installed, download it [here](https://www.anaconda.com/products/distribution) and install it on your system.  

After installing Anaconda, launch Jupyter Notebook through the Anaconda Navigator for an easy-to-use interface.  

### Libraries Used  
You need the following Python libraries:  
- Pandas  
- Matplotlib  
- Seaborn  

You can install them using pip or through Anaconda Navigator:  
```bash  
pip install pandas matplotlib seaborn
